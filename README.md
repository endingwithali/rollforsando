# Roll For Sandwich Online


Created this project using create-react-app 

To run / local develop: 
```
 npm start
```


This project was inspired by [Jake Pauwels' "Roll for Sandwich"](https://www.polygon.com/23169570/roll-for-sandwich-interview") videos.

## How it works

Fill each text box relative to the following categories: breads (ie rye, sourdough, wheat), mains (ie tofu, turkey meat, roast beef deli slices), cheese (ie vegan cheddar, swiss), roughage (ie leafy greens, pickles, onion), wild magic (ie potato chips, scroop of ice cream, banana slices), and sauce (ie hot sauce, peanut butter). Check if you want to include rolling for a chance to toast your bread. Hit "Roll for Sandwich", and the other side will spit out a randomly generated sandwich for you to build!

## Why so many options?
        
The original number of options directly reflects the same number of options per food category used in the Jake Pauwels' videos. You can press the "-" button next to the text boxes to remove unused options. In addition, you can add more text field options by pressing the "Add New Ingredient" button.
